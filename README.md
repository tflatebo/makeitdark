# Slack dark theme injector tool
This tool writes a dark theme to the Slack desktop application.
Dark theme was taken from the generated [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org)
theme that was applied when I visited the web version of slack, like so:
```
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.darkreader')).map((n) => n.textContent).join('\n');

```

### Prerequisites

Install [python](https://www.python.org/)

You _really_ should take the css file from this site, and host it somewhere _you_ control. It's
not a great idea to have a script inject an arbitrary CSS file from a domain outside of your control,
into an application like Slack that could have sensitive data.

Don't trust me - fork the repo.

### Running

Mac
```bash
sudo chmod o+w /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js
python makeitdark.py
sudo chmod o-w /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js
```
```bash
sudo chmod o+w /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js
python3 makeitdark.py
sudo chmod o-w /Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js
```

Linux
```
python makeitdark.py
```

Windows
```bash
python makeitdark.py
```
### Sidebar

Add this sidebar theme for consistency which kinda makes it look like Mojave dark mode, from [slackthemes.net](https://slackthemes.net):
```
#17181c,#252525,#A36B31,#D2D6D6,#5C6380,#DEDEDE,#ADBA4E,#DB6668
```

### Reverting

If you want to uninstall the dark Slack theme you can run with the `makeitlight` option:
```
makeitdark.py makeitlight
```

### Slack Updates

When Slack updates it will overwrite the installed dark theme. When this happens just re-run the tool to make it dark again.
